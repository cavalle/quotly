Story: User registration
  As a visitor
  I want to register in q.uot.es
  So that I can manage my collections of quotations in a social fashion
  
  Scenario: A visitor succesfully register in q.uot.es
    Given no user with 'juan@juan.com' email exists
    And no user with 'juan' login exists
    
    When visitor goes to the home page
    And clicks on 'Register'
    Then the registration form should be shown
    
    When fills in Login with 'juan'
    And fills in Email with 'juan@juan.com'
    And fills in Password with 'password'
    And fills in Confirm Password with 'password'
    Then an user with 'juan' login and 'juan@juan.com' email should exist
    And page should include a notice 'You have been registered in q.uot.es!'
    And an email should have been sent to the user with a subject that includes 'You've been registered' and body that includes username and password
